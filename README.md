## Overview


### Mobile View

This project is a fully responsive website built as part of a real-world web design experiment. The goal was to design, build, and deploy a client facing website while gaining practical experience with modern frontend frameworks, responsiveness, and real world constraints.

The business itself is no longer active, but the project remains as a technical and learning reference.
